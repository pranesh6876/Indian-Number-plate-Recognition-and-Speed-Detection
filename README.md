# Indian-Number-plate-Recognition-and-Speed-Detection
Number Plate and Speed detection using Image Recognition

PURPOSE:
Transportation by road is one of the major factors that affects the commercial development of any country. With the increasing vehicle population and their movement on the roads, accidents are also steadily increasing. According to the 'Indian Road Accidents Survey', every year there are more than 135,000 incidents of road accidents. Out of these, most of them are due to rash driving. According to Indian Constitution, IPC section 279 , rash driving is an offence. So, our idea is to design a module which can detect the vehicle whenever it is rashly driven or driven above permissible speed limit, and transmit the data to the concerned authority.


PROJECT OVERVIEW:
In this project we aim to design a system for vehicle speed estimation from videos captured in urban roadways. The system detects the numbers on the license plate of a vehicle in real-time and note its speed. If the speed of the vehicle is over a certain limit, we send the message to stop them at next traffic signal. This system can be widely used in day-to-day traffic signals to maintain traffic rules.

Component Requirements
OpenCV(software):
Open Source Computer Vision Library is cross platform and a set of programming functions for real time applications. OpenCV library contains more than five hundred optimized algorithms. It is mostly used around the world, with forty thousand people in the user group. The languages which are used in the open computer vision platform are C, C++,python. The library is mainly written in C, which makes it portable to some specific platforms such as Digital Signal Processor.
